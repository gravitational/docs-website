## Installation

Here is a test for including variables in an MDX file.

Here are instructions for installing version 10:

```code
$ curl -OL https://example.com/downloads/mysoftware-v10.tar
$ tar -xvf mysoftware-v10.tar
```

We no longer support version 9.

If installation fails, you will see the following error message:

```text
Installation has failed!
```

If installation succeeds, you will see this message:

```text
Installation==successful! Type "Continue" to proceed.
```

After you type "Continue", you will see this message:

```text
Type 'next' to see the next screen.
```

After that, you will see this message:

```text
Type "final" to see the final screen.
```
